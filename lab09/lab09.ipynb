    "Diabetic patients have the yellow histogram and non-diabetic patients have the blue histogram. We can see that there are some differences between the two distributions. The diabetic histogram seems to have values which are on average above the mean. We can see this because its center, or where is peaks is above 0 (again we are in standard units) and the non-diabetic histogram has a center below zero. We can see from the histograms that those with diabetes seem to have higher Blood Pressure than those without diabetes in our dataset. We can also see that the distribution is not that significant becuse the histograms seem to overlap quite a bit. This agrees with our above table when we found the difference in BloodPressure means between group 0 and 1."
